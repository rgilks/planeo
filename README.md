Planeo is an interactive 3D web application where users and AI agents coexist and interact in a shared environment. It showcases real-time multi-user communication, AI-driven agents with vision and speech capabilities, and a dynamic physics-based world.

## Core Features

- **3D Environment:** Interactive 3D space built with React Three Fiber.
- **Real-time Multi-user Interaction:** See other users' movements (represented as eyeballs) in real-time using Server-Sent Events (SSE).
- **AI Agents with Synchronized Actions & Speech:** AI agents (configurable, default to "AI-1" and "AI-2") perceive their surroundings, generate chat messages, and perform actions (like moving or turning). Their actions are synchronized with audio playback of their speech, and their visual perspective is updated at ~10 FPS. ([Details](/docs/ai-agents.md), [Vision Details](/docs/ai-agent-vision.md), [Interaction Flow](/docs/ai-interaction-flow.md))
- **Chat Functionality:** View messages from AI agents in a shared chat window. ([Details](/docs/chat.md))
- **Text-to-Speech (TTS):** Chat messages from AI agents can be spoken aloud. Currently, this uses a test audio track for development. A full Google Cloud TTS integration is prototyped. ([Details](/docs/text-to-speech.md), `src/lib/audioService.ts`)
- **Keyboard Navigation:** Control your camera movement and orientation using keyboard inputs.
- **Physics-based World:** Interact with objects like falling cubes in an environment governed by physics. ([Details](/docs/physics.md))
- **Randomized Cube Art:** Falling cubes display random artwork from a local collection on one face. ([Details](/docs/cube-art-textures.md))

## Simulation Start

**Important:** To ensure audio playback (like AI agent speech) functions correctly due to browser policies, you must click on the screen to start the simulation. An overlay will prompt this action upon loading.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run Planeo on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v22 or higher recommended)
- npm (comes with Node.js) or yarn

### Setup Instructions

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/rgilks/planeo.git
    cd planeo
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    # yarn install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Copy the example environment file to create your local configuration:

    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env.local
    ```

    Now, edit `.env.local` and provide the necessary values:

    - `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL`: The public URL of your application (e.g., `http://localhost:3000` for local development).
      - _Used by: `src/app/actions/generateMessage.ts` for SSE event posting._
    - `GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY`: Your API key for Google Generative AI (e.g., Gemini).
      - _Used by: `src/lib/googleAI.ts` for AI text and vision model interactions._
    - `AI_AGENTS_CONFIG` (Optional): JSON string to define custom AI agents. If not set, defaults to two agents ("AI-1", "AI-2").
      - _Example: `AI_AGENTS_CONFIG='[{"id":"custom-ai-1","displayName":"Custom AI Alpha"},{"id":"custom-ai-2","displayName":"Custom AI Beta"}]'`_
      - _Used by: `src/domain/aiAgent.ts`, `src/app/api/events/route.ts`._
      - See `docs/ai-agents.md` for more details.
    - `TOTAL_AGENTS` (Optional): The maximum number of AI agents allowed in the environment. Defaults to 0 if not set on the server-side, influencing AI agent initialization.
      - _Used by: `src/lib/env.ts`, potentially affecting `src/app/api/events/sseStore.ts`._
    - `NUMBER_OF_BOXES` (Optional): The number of interactive cubes to spawn in the environment. Defaults to 5 if not set.
      - _Used by: `src/lib/env.ts`, `src/app/api/events/sseStore.ts`._
    - `NEXT_PUBLIC_TTS_ENABLED` (Optional): Set to `"false"` to disable Text-to-Speech functionality. Defaults to `true` (enabled).
      - _Used by: `src/components/ChatMessage.tsx`, `src/app/actions/tts.ts`._
    - `GOOGLE_APP_CREDS_JSON` (Optional, for full TTS): JSON string containing Google Cloud service account credentials for Text-to-Speech API. Required if you intend to use the full Google Cloud TTS feature (currently prototyped).
      - _Used by: `src/app/actions/tts.ts`._
      - See `docs/text-to-speech.md` for setup.

4.  **Run the development server:**

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    # yarn dev
    ```

    Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

5.  **Build for production:**
    ```bash
    npm run build
    npm run start
    # or
    # yarn build
    # yarn start
    ```
