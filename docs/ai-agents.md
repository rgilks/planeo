# AI Agents

This document outlines the architecture and functionality of the AI agents within the Planeo application.

## Overview

Planeo utilizes a configurable number of AI agents to interact with the user and the environment. These agents can generate chat messages and respond to visual stimuli.

## Identity and Management

AI agent definitions are managed in `src/domain/aiAgent.ts`. This file provides:

- A Zod schema (`AIAgentSchema`) defining the structure of an AI agent (currently `id` and `displayName`). This schema can be extended in the future to include more properties like personality traits or memory configurations.
- A function `getAIAgents(): AIAgent[]` which loads AI agent configurations from the `AI_AGENTS_CONFIG` environment variable. This variable should contain a JSON string representing an array of AI agent objects.
  - Example `AI_AGENTS_CONFIG` in an `.env` file:
    ```env
    AI_AGENTS_CONFIG='[{"id":"ai-agent-001","displayName":"Agent1"},{"id":"ai-agent-002","displayName":"Agent2"}]'
    ```
  - If the environment variable is missing or contains invalid JSON, `getAIAgents()` will return an empty array and log a warning/error.
- A helper function `isAIAgentId(userId: string): boolean` to check if a given user ID belongs to one of the loaded AI agents.
- A helper function `getAIAgentById(userId: string): AIAgent | undefined` to retrieve the full details of a specific AI agent by its ID.

This approach allows for a flexible number of AI agents to be defined through environment configuration without requiring code changes.

## Behavior

### Chat Message Generation

When an AI agent generates a chat message (via `generateAiChatMessage` in `src/app/actions/generateMessage.ts`), the prompt history provided to the underlying language model correctly identifies messages from _any_ AI agent as originating from "AI". This ensures that the context for the responding AI is accurate, regardless of which AI agent spoke previously or how many agents are active.

### Vision Response Generation

For vision-based responses (via `generateAiVisionResponse`), the AI agent adopts a specific persona: an AI that has just awoken in a strange environment with no memories. The prompt system for this function is designed to reinforce this persona. Messages from other AI agents are treated as external user input from this persona's perspective.

## Event Broadcasting

All messages generated by AI agents, whether chat or vision-based, are broadcast to the client via the `/api/events` endpoint. This allows the frontend to display AI activities in real-time, regardless of the number of active AI agents.

## Future Considerations

- **Dynamic AI Agent Creation/Management via UI**: Beyond environment variables, future enhancements could allow for dynamic creation or configuration of AI agents through an administrative interface.
- **Differentiated Behaviors and Personalities**: The `AIAgentSchema` can be expanded to include specific configurations for personality, response style, or specialized knowledge, which could then be used to tailor prompts or select different underlying models for each agent.
